# Wine Quality
Wine Quality is my first project working on my own. When reading the description of the data, I learned that most people use this dataset to classify wines as either good, or not good. However, being that I just studied linear regression in the book, I wanted to try to rate the wines from 1 to 10. This ended up not being possible because there are no wines with very high or very low rating in the dataset. Despite this I still built a linear regression. I will build plenty of classifiers in the future and realize that a linear regressor is not the best model for this data. I hope the viewer can appreciate the thought process and diligence; despite the model type.
