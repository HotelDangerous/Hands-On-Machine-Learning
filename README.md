# Hands-On-Machine-Learning

At the time of writing this, I am a graduate student studying to receive a M.S. in Data Science - Artificial Intelligence. Much of the work we do in school is theoretical, other than some projects. To supplement the theoretical with the practical, I am reading **Hand-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** by Aurelien Geron. These files are my attempts at the excercises in the book.
